### Lets get started

Link it up!

    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="assets/css/normalize.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="assets/css/plum.css">

```plum.css``` includes all the stuff that you need to use plum, there's also
a minified version of this and you can use that if you want.
<br/>
```normalize.css``` makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards. It precisely targets only the styles that need normalizing.
